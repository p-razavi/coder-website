I am a behavioral data scientist with a Ph.D. in Social and Personality Psychology. I specialize in synthesizing statistical modeling with theories of behavior and cognition to address human-centered questions. My career journey has taken me from leading academic research projects about emotions in different social contexts, to the dynamic world of statistical consultation and industry research, working on a variety of problems across fields such as healthcare, financial decision making, hospitality, and education.

I am driven by curiosity and enjoy collaborative work, especially when it involves learning new topics and skills. Feel free to reach out and connect via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pooyarazavi/) if we have shared interests, or if you want to discuss opportunities for work and collaboration.
