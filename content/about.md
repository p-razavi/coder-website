I am a social scientist, research methodologist, and applied psychometrician. I am passionate about using sound research methods to solve real-world problems. 

I have seven years of experience applying statistical, methodological, and analytics approaches in research on a variety of topics and different settings. For example, I have led more than 15 research projects on emotional experiences (e.g., anger, awe, and loneliness) and how such experiences affect our cognition, decision-making, and interpersonal relationships. Furthermore, as a methodologist and statistical consultant, I have made significant contributions to projects focused on increasing people's donations, testing and improving the quality of digital mental health and educational products, and promoting more effective financial decisions.  

I am flexible in my choice of research tools and approaches and do not hesitate to seek out new data or methods if they might help improve people's experiences or outcomes. Over the years, this has resulted in a diverse repertoire of research skills. Methodologically, I have a strong track record in developing and validating surveys, designing and conducting online and in-person experiments, and in-depth interviews. For each project, I choose methodology depending on the research goals and practical organizational considerations.

Analytically, I regularly use methods such as OLS regression, structural equation modeling, dimensionality assessment and reduction, Bayesian multi-level modeling, and Natural Language Processing techniques (e.g., LDA and LIWC), as well as qualitative thematic analysis of interview and open-ended text data. You can find brief descriptions of the projects where I have used these methods on the [Projects]({{< ref "/projects" >}} "Projects") page. 

I am strongly driven by curiosity and enjoy collaborative work, especially when it involves learning new topics and skills.
